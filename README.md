# Study Hub - Web Development Project

Welcome to the repository for the Web Development Project, the first group project as part of our Information Technology studies. This project involves the implementation of a web app/site using TypeScript, NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL. The development process is guided by the principles of Scrum, an agile methodology widely employed in the ICT industry.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this course is to collaboratively develop an educational and support web application named "Study Hub." This platform is designed to assist students and individuals seeking help with their programming tasks by providing a space to post questions, seek guidance, and engage with a supportive community.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** Leveraging the benefits of static typing for enhanced code quality and maintainability.
- **NodeJS:** Serving as the runtime environment for the application.
- **Express:** Facilitating the development of robust and scalable server-side applications.
- **PostgreSQL:** Serving as the relational database management system to store and manage data efficiently.

## Development Process

The project is managed using the Scrum framework, an agile methodology that enables iterative and flexible development. The Scrum approach includes regular sprint cycles, sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews to ensure continuous improvement and adaptability to evolving requirements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/study-hub-web-dev.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd study-hub-web-dev`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the application: `npm start`
5. Access the Study Hub app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`

Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or provide feedback. We appreciate your interest in our project, and we hope Study Hub becomes a valuable resource for the programming community.
